# Flight Assistant

Conversational flight concierge at [flights.evanburkeen.com](https://flights.evanburkeen.com) —
talk to Claude, which pulls live Google Flights data to search, compare, and recommend.

> This README is the living record of the project: how it works, how to run it,
> what has shipped, and the operational lessons learned. Update the Changelog
> with every push.

## Stack

| Layer | What |
|---|---|
| Hosting | Vercel serverless (Python), auto-deploys on push to `main` (`EvanBurkeen/flight-search`) |
| Backend | [api/index.py](api/index.py) — FastAPI, single `/api/search` endpoint |
| LLM | `claude-opus-4-8` agent loop, `max_retries=4`, effort `medium`, prompt-cached system+tools |
| Flight data | [`fli`](https://github.com/punitarani/fli) (PyPI `flights`) — reverse-engineered Google Flights |
| Web context | Anthropic server-side `web_search` tool (max 3/turn) for event dates, venues, etc. |
| Coordinates | `airportsdata` (IATA → lat/lon) for route maps |
| Frontend | Single static [public/index.html](public/index.html), Alpine.js, no build step |
| Map data | [public/world.js](public/world.js): Natural Earth 110m land + lakes as SVG paths |

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` lives only in Vercel env. Optional `FLI_PROXY` env routes all
Google traffic through a proxy (see Operations).

## How a turn works

1. Frontend POSTs `{query, history}` (history = last 12 user/assistant text turns).
2. `run_assistant` runs an agent loop (≤3 search rounds, ≤8 API calls, **65s turn budget**):
   Claude converses and calls `search_flights` (up to 5/turn, executed **concurrently**)
   and/or `web_search`. `pause_turn` (server-side search) is resumed automatically.
3. `execute_spec` per search: roll past dates forward (with a visible note) →
   resolve airports (multi-airport cities supported) → build fli filters
   (cabin, stops, airlines, alliances, price cap, times, currency pinned USD) →
   `run_search` (retry ladder: sort → sort → CHEAPEST; 15s fli timeout) →
   post-process:
   - `via_airports` filter over the FULL result set (the only trustworthy way to
     assert a routing exists/doesn't)
   - arrival-day + arrival-time enforcement app-side (`arrival_ok`) — Google's own
     arrival filter is clock-hour based and unusable
   - serialize up to 50 one-ways / 10 round-trip combos / 8 multi-city itineraries,
     each with true per-itinerary booking URL, alliance tag, aircraft, warnings
     (tight <45m connections, overnight, self-transfer, airport change), CO2 delta,
     and `route_points` (with per-stop `layover_min`) for the map.
4. Claude sees a **compact top-6 summary per search** (with route endpoints and an
   explicit truncation warning); the browser gets everything.
5. Reply text ends with a `SUGGESTIONS: [...]` line → stripped and rendered as
   tappable follow-up chips.
6. Trip types: one-way, round-trip (priced as complete itineraries), multi-city
   (2–5 legs, one ticket), flexible-date grids (`SearchDates`, round-trip duration
   supported).

### Assistant behavior rules (prompt-enforced)

- Concierge voice; no em/en dashes; `**bold**` only.
- Ground every fare/time claim in tool results; quote airports exactly from the
  `route` field (EWR is not JFK).
- Ask ONE question only when origin is missing or destination is a whole region;
  otherwise assume and state assumptions.
- Arrival-day intent → `arrival_date` + timezone logic (Asia→US lands same day).
- Small regional airports with no service → widen to nearby majors, say the drive.
- Never claim a route doesn't exist without a `via_airports`-filtered search.

## Frontend features

Chat with stop/supersede (send during a search cancels and re-asks) · Detailed/Compact
views (global toggle + per-section override) · top-picks preview with "Show all N"
and instant client-side filters (sort, departure window, duration, airline, alliance,
stops — options derived from the data) · flexible-date grids show best-value dates
first (within 15% of cheapest) · per-flight atlas maps (land+lakes, graticule,
sequential longitude unwrapping so every leg takes the short way; outbound solid,
return dashed; layover dots with durations) · timeline layover rings · suggestion
chips · concierge styling (Fraunces serif, brass fittings, boarding-pass dividers,
time-of-day greeting).

## Local development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt uvicorn
.venv/bin/python scripts/dev_server.py   # API + frontend on :8123
```

No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` locally → the Claude loop is stubbed by a pattern parser
(`scripts/dev_server.py`); searches still hit live Google. Stub grammar: airport
codes, "round", "flex/weekend", "compare", "multi A B C".

## Operations

- **Google throttles datacenter IPs in waves.** Symptom: empty results/429s in prod
  while the identical search works from a residential IP (diagnose exactly that way).
  Mitigations built in: retry ladders, 15s fli timeout, 65s turn budget, honest
  "Google is slow" messaging. Stopgap: rotate `regions` in [vercel.json](vercel.json)
  — but pools burn in ~1–3 days of active use (July 2026 burn order:
  iad1 → sfo1 → cle1 → pdx1 → fra1). **Durable fix:** set `FLI_PROXY` in Vercel to a
  residential-proxy URL; the code already routes all Google traffic through it.
- Currency is pinned to USD in every search, so non-US regions are safe.
- Anthropic 429/529 overloads surface as a polite try-again message.
- fli quirks: `SortBy.BEST` intermittently returns None (fallback to CHEAPEST);
  multi-city is slow (fan-out capped at `top_n=4`, `maxDuration` 300s).
- `world.js` is cache-busted by query string (`?v=2`); bump it when regenerating.

## Changelog

**July 15, 2026 (later)**
- Fix stray mid-sentence line breaks in replies: renderer joins soft wraps into
  flowing text (paragraphs and lists preserved); prompt forbids manual wrapping
- FLI_PROXY activated in production: IPRoyal rotating US-residential proxy for all
  Google traffic — ends the datacenter-IP throttle waves and the region roulette
- Region back to iad1 (US East; Google egress now goes through the proxy, so the
  server region only affects Claude/API latency)

**July 15, 2026**
- Sequential longitude unwrapping — complex routes (FLL-BOS-CDG-PVG) no longer draw across the wrong ocean
- Layover rings on card timelines; layover durations on map dots; capped map padding + 5-wide world tiling
- Region fra1 (fourth US pool burned); README rewritten as living doc

**July 14, 2026**
- Reliability: FLI_PROXY plumbing, USD pinning, Anthropic retry/backoff + polite overload messages, 15s fli timeouts, 65s turn budget, per-search deadlines
- Latency: parallel search execution (3x on comparisons), prompt caching, trimmed retries
- Web search tool for real-world context (event dates/venues)
- Fix airport misstatements (route endpoints now visible to the model); region-vague queries ask one question; small-airport widening
- Round-trip maps draw both directions (dashed return); flexible-date grids collapse to best-value dates
- Concierge voice (no dashes); crest/stationery/boarding-pass styling; map lakes + atlas look; per-itinerary booking links (BDL-JAX bug); alliance dropdown + tags

**July 13, 2026**
- v5 conversational assistant: Claude agent loop with search_flights tool, comparisons (up to 4 searches/turn), suggestion chips, stop/supersede, no-autoscroll
- Multi-city (one-ticket pricing); arrival-day targeting; past-date rolling; via_airports filter (HND hallucination fix); Detailed/Compact + per-section toggles; full-list browse with client-side filters; route maps with real coastlines; portal redesign
- Regions iad1 → sfo1 → cle1 → pdx1 as pools burned; 300s maxDuration

**July 12, 2026**
- v4 rewrite on fli: real round-trip pricing, native filters, flexible dates, Claude tool-use parser; 429 backoff handling; arrival-window enforcement

**May 3, 2026**
- Full rewrite: Next.js/SerpAPI → Python/FastAPI/fli

**January 2026**
- v1–v3: original Next.js + SerpAPI prototypes (two-step round trips, debug eras)
